## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML 5 markup
- CSS (via SCSS)
  - Custom properties
  - Flexbox
  - Grid layout
  - Pseudo-classes
  - Pseudo-elements
- JSON-LD - for microdata
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It is possible to present reviews and ratings by people using a product or a service in microdata.

### Continued development

I still have to learn about how to make front-end development in a more efficient way and to learn to manage to build web pages without seeming to be too slow.

### Useful resources

- [Schema.org](https://schema.org) - This helped me to find the properties to use to mark up the reviews and ratings. More generally, this is a must-have to implement microdata in a web page, whether they are implemented within the HTML code or in JSOn-LD.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to aknowledge one of the teachers of the course I have been at [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/en-GB) for having suggested, during the first week of the course, that the students who had made progress in their CSS scheduled exercises to do some of the challenges proposed by Frontend Mentor, if they wished.
